    "description": "Artificial Intelligence has rapidly achieved technical maturity across its first two developmental levels, yet organizational maturity has not kept pace. This panel examines the critical gap between AI capability and institutional readiness. It will explore how targeted capacity building, across leadership, workforce, governance, and processes, can unlock AI's full value. The discussion focuses on activating impact from the bottom of the value chain, ensuring AI adoption translates into measurable outcomes rather than isolated technological success.",
